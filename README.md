# supplychain-firewall-benchmark-hello

A benign benchmark package to evaluate how SCA tools and repository firewalls behave with a clean baseline.

## Usage

```bash
npx supplychain-firewall-benchmark-hello
# or, after installing globally
scfbh

## Output
```
Hello world from supplychain-firewall-benchmark-hello v1.0.0. First version is just a happy and clean package :D
```

v1.0.0 is safe and side-effect-free.
Later versions may include controlled test artifacts (EICAR test file, obfuscated install hook) for research purposes.
